Due to low auc score, I decided not to drop correlated columns, but i dropped columns which has no informativity such as 'pre_loans_total_overdue', 'is_zero_loans5', 'is_zero_loans530', 'is_zero_loans3060', 'is_zero_loans6090', 'is_zero_loans90', 'is_zero_util', 'is_zero_over2limit', 'is_zero_maxover2limit'. the best model was xgboost model with auc = 0.716, i tried xgboost model which auc 0.710, tried to stack them, due to their similarity, auc was fallen, outliers were not droppen due to the same reason
